Let's talk a little about me.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me.png)

My name is Brittney Miller and I'm an aspiring web developer. I am a graduate of Kennesaw State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, concentration in Mobile and Web technologies. In my spare time I like to create websites, love stargazing and astrophotography, and I'm also a huge Harry Potter fan, and you can expect me to be talking about these things!

Check out [my website](https://www.brittneymiller.com/) to see some cool projects I have worked on!

Until next time!
