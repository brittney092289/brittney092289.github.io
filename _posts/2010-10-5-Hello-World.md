<h2>Welcome to my Coding Diary!</h2>

I've thought about this for a while and I finally started it! But why have I decided to keep a coding diary? I have come up with a list of reasons that I think will benefit me (and also others who use this tactic).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/hello-world.png)

<h3>THE LIST</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Vocalize and Visualize Ideas</li>
  By keeping a coding journal, I hope to be able to better organize and plan my projects by formulating steps, documenting my work, and setting goals. And hopefully this will spark some creativity and help me come up with some pretty neat ideas for future projects. 
  <li>Build upon Coding and Problem Solving Skills</li>
  When I run into a bug, writing out the problem will force me to slow down and understand what is happening and why it is happening. This will allow me to run through the code and think about the problem more logically by describing the issue in my own words.
  <li>Reflecting and Pursuing Progress</li>
  Keeping a coding journal will document my learning progress through the years. It'll be a self-assigned report card. I'm hoping that I can look back on these posts and laugh at myself a little, but mostly be extremely proud of how much I've learned and how far I've come.
  <li>Promoting Communication and Collaboration</li>
  Writing blog posts can help others see things from my perspective, which would not be possible with a private journal! By putting my thoughts out there, I increase the probability of someone finding and <em>enjoying</em> my work, which in turn can help me form connections, promote teamwork, and gather positive support and input from peers and future employers.
</ol>

So here's to the future of my coding diary ðŸŽ‰ I hope to see you again!
<h4>Stay Tuned!</h4>
