<h1>Greetings!</h1>

<strong>My name is Brittney!</strong>

I am a graduate of Kennesaw State University with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Information Technology, concentration in Mobile and Web Technologies. My passion is web development and I am constantly learning and improving my skills to enhance my knowledge of the industry. My strengths are in front-end web development using technologies such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery frameworks. I am seeking opportunities to use my knowledge of web technologies while continuously learning and enhancing my skills.


In my spare time, I enjoy doing astrophotography, painting, and brushing up on my Harry Potter lore.

Let's work together! Feel free to [contact me](https://www.brittneymiller.com/)!
